/**
 * Provides a collection of static methods to support comfortable loading and
 * storing of objects as XML data.
 * <p>
 * This class uses the classes {@link XMLEncoder} and
 * {@link XMLDecoder} to encode and decode an object
 * to and from an XML file for long term persistence.
 * It allows you to provide custom {@link PersistenceDelegate}
 * instances for the serialisation of any classes which do not implement the
 * JavaBean design pattern and are not supported by {@code XMLEncoder}
 * as a default.
 * <p>
 * For the latter case, {@code PersistenceService} offers the
 * {@link #setPersistenceDelegate(Class, PersistenceDelegate)} method which
 * could be called from a static initializer block in the class which would
 * like to use {@code PersistenceService}'s {@code store} and {@code load}
 * methods.
 * <p>
 * Note that the Java API already provides some default persistence delegates
 * for some classes of its API which are not JavaBeans. If in doubt, simply
 * test the class before writing a custom {@code PersistenceDelegate}.
 * If you see exceptions happening, you most probably need to provide a 
 * {@code PersistenceDelegate} and use the {@code setPersistenceDelegate}
 * method to install it.
 * <p>
 * Note that the store and load methods in this class have been designed
 * to deal with <em>any</em> kind of {@link Throwable}s throughout the course
 * of (de)serialization, even {@link OutOfMemoryError}s.
 * <p>
 * This class is thread.safe.

     * <p>
     * This must be called prior to the {@code store} methods for each class
     * which's instances are to be persisted.
     * Thus, a good place to make this call is in a <em>static initializer
     * block</em> for the corresponding class.
     * Here is an example:
     * {@code <pre>
     *      class PersistentObject {
     *          static {
     *              PersistenceService.setPersistenceDelegate(
     *                  PersistentObject.class,
     *                  new DefaultPersistenceDelegate(
     *                      new String[] { "property" }));
     *          }
     *
     *          public int property;
     *
     *          public PersistentObject(int property) {
     *              this.property = property;
     *          }
     *      }
     * </pre>}
     * <p>
     * Note that you should not use this method for any class which's source
     * code you can control.
     * The preferred way to associate a persistence delegate with a class is
     * to write a {@code BeanInfo} class which's
     * {@code BeanDescriptor} has an attribute set with
     * {@code "persistenceDelegate"} as its name and the respective
     * persistence delegate as its value
     * (see {@link Encoder#getPersistenceDelegate}).
     * However, this method is still useful in case you can't control the
     * source code, as then at least you can still associate a persistence
     * delegate to this class.
